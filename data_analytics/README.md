# :hospital: Thoracic Surgery Survival Prediction: Project Overview
* Built a model using the [thoracic surgery dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thoracic+Surgery+Data) to predict the likelihood that a patient will survive for more than 1 year after thoracic surgeries have been performed
* Experimented with 4 different model families: information-based learning, similarity-based learning, error-based learning, and clustering
* Addressed imbalanced dataset with cost sensitive learning and oversampling techniques
